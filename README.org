#+description: An example C program with nix and cmake

* Test C Program
This is an example of how you can use nix and cmake together in C projects!

** Building
Choose wisely ;)
*** Via CMake
To configure and build your program.
#+begin_src bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
#+end_src
Our executable is built in the same directory.  To execute:
#+begin_src bash
./test
#+end_src
*** Via Nix
To build with nix
#+begin_src bash
nix build
#+end_src
The result should be produced in a results folder. Alternatively, you could use:
#+begin_src
nix run
#+end_src
to build and run.
